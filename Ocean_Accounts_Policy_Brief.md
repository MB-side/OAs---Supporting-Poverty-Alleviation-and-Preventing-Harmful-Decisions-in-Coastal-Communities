# Policy Briefing: Making Ocean Health Visible in Poverty Reduction

**Ocean accounts provide a systematic framework for integrating marine ecosystem data into poverty reduction strategies, enabling policymakers to design interventions that protect both human wellbeing and coastal ecosystems.**

---

## Summary

Over 3 billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods, yet environmental dimensions are systematically excluded from national poverty reduction policies and measurements. This disconnect creates a critical knowledge gap: development and conservation interventions often fail or cause unintended harm because policymakers lack integrated information on how coastal communities depend on ocean health. Ocean accounts—systematic frameworks that combine environmental, social, and economic data—offer a practical solution to close this gap and identify equitable pathways toward sustainable development that strengthen both poverty reduction and ocean conservation.

## The Problem: Invisible Dependencies, Visible Failures

### Scale of Ocean Dependence
Natural capital comprises **36% of total wealth in developing countries**, compared to just 2% in OECD nations. For coastal communities, this disparity is even starker: ecosystem services contribute an estimated **47-89% of the "GDP of the poor"** in developing countries, yet this economic reality remains largely invisible in national accounts and policy frameworks.

Environmental income typically represents **20-30% of household income** for poor people globally, with particularly high dependence in Latin America (32%) and Africa (30%). This income often comes from informal, non-market activities—fishing, farming, forestry—that do not appear in official statistics and therefore do not influence policy priorities.

### The Policy Gap
Despite well-documented linkages between ocean health and coastal livelihoods, only **6 of 42 countries** with official multidimensional poverty indices include environmental factors in their measurement frameworks. This omission has profound consequences: policies designed to reduce poverty frequently undermine the natural asset base upon which vulnerable communities depend, inadvertently deepening poverty rather than alleviating it.

Three mechanisms drive this failure:

**1. Information asymmetry.** Conventional economic indicators value only marketed ecosystem services (fish catches). Unpriced services—coastal protection from mangroves, nutrient cycling, fish nursery habitats—remain undocumented and uninfluential in decisions. Markets value only a small subset of marine ecosystem benefits, leaving policymakers without full information when deciding how to manage these systems.

**2. Distributional blindness.** Development and conservation policies rarely account for how costs and benefits distribute across poor versus wealthy groups. Large-scale commercial fishing interests, for example, may appear economically rational until ocean accounts reveal how they displace small-scale fishers who lack alternative livelihoods.

**3. Institutional fragmentation.** Natural resource management, poverty reduction, and environmental protection operate through separate institutions with disconnected information systems, making it impossible to address the real-life interdependencies these challenges create.

### Consequences of Uninformed Decisions
The costs of this disconnect are visible in concrete failures. The **Nippon Causeway in Kiribati** (constructed 1985) improved transportation connectivity but altered lagoon water cycling, leading to waste accumulation, contaminated water and shellfish, algal blooms, declining fish populations, and increased operating costs for traditional fishers—outcomes that devastated the livelihoods of the people it was intended to serve. A **shrimp aquaculture project in Sri Lanka** appeared economically viable in conventional cost-benefit analysis (1.5:1 benefit-to-cost ratio), but when wider environmental impacts were evaluated, costs exceeded benefits by **1:6 to 1:11**—a dramatic reversal driven by ecosystem service losses invisible in standard accounting.

## The Solution: Ocean Accounts as Evidence Infrastructure

Ocean accounts provide a systematic information system describing the natural, social, and economic assets that poor people depend on for income, livelihoods, health, security, and resilience. Rather than a single valuation exercise, they constitute an ongoing framework for integrating environmental and social data into policymaking processes.

### What Ocean Accounts Reveal

Ocean accounts make visible the **multiple dimensions of coastal vulnerability** by tracking:

- **Natural resource reliance**: Which communities depend most on healthy marine environments and lack alternative economic opportunities
- **Geographic vulnerability**: Which coastal populations face greatest exposure to environmental degradation, pollution, and climate impacts  
- **Ecosystem service distribution**: Who benefits from ocean ecosystem services and who suffers from degradation
- **Adaptive capacity**: Which communities have least access to infrastructure and resources needed for climate adaptation
- **Social inequities**: How women, youth, and ethnic minorities face additional barriers through limited resource rights and constrained mobility
- **Generational impacts**: How environmental degradation perpetuates poverty cycles through depleted natural capital

This multidimensional analysis moves beyond income-based poverty measurement to capture how oceans contribute to human wellbeing—revealing both immediate economic needs and long-term community resilience.

### Practical Evidence: When Accounts Transform Decisions

**Inhambane Bay, Mozambique**: Ocean accounts quantified ecosystem services across 400,000 hectares of coastal ecosystems, revealing how diverse services (fishing, shellfish collection, nursery habitats, coastal protection) support both immediate economic needs and long-term resilience. The process highlighted groups not included in national statistics and exposed limitations in the national data system. Result: The Mozambican government is now considering integrating ocean dependence metrics into the national census—a systemic shift driven by evidence.

**Philippines (Palawan and Laguna Lake)**: Ecosystem accounts captured competing values in two regions where poor communities and commercial interests competed over natural resources. In Palawan, accounts provided objective evidence of long-run benefits of forest conservation for tourism, sustainable fisheries, and water regulation—giving weight to arguments that benefited local livelihoods over short-term mining profits. In Laguna Lake, quantified losses in fish catch and water quality elevated the voices of small-scale fishers in policy discussions. Result: These early examples influenced the Philippines' continued work on ecosystem accounting as a tool for poverty reduction and rural development strategies.

## Key Enablers and Critical Numbers

- **3 billion+ people** depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for livelihoods
- **36% of developing country wealth** is natural capital
- **20-30% of poor household income** comes from environmental sources
- **132 million additional people** could be pushed into poverty by climate change by 2030 (compared to 2020 baseline)
- **Only 6 of 42 countries** with multidimensional poverty indices include environmental factors
- **19% of mangroves** lost between 1980-2005; **75% of coral reefs** now threatened

## Donor Opportunities: From Evidence to Institutional Change

Ocean accounts are advancing slowly because institutional frameworks lag scientific evidence. Effective uptake requires three coordinated investments:

**1. Evidence generation.** Support developing countries to establish baseline ocean accounts for critical resources (fisheries, mangroves, coral reefs, water). Start with pragmatic "quick-start" approaches focusing on 2-3 ecosystem services most relevant to coastal poverty (coastal protection, fish production, tourism), then expand methodology over time as capacity builds.

**2. Capacity building.** Invest in systematic institutional coordination—connecting national statistics agencies, environmental ministries, and development planning bodies. Use a whole-of-government approach to data assembly and analysis, improving likelihood that accounts inform cross-institutional, high-level decisions and generate systemic solutions rather than isolated projects.

**3. Institutionalization.** Support policy dialogue processes that move ocean accounts from special projects to standard government practice. The value is not just in account development but in the conversations this process opens with ministries and planning authorities. Emphasize transparency and accessibility of findings to poor groups—social networking, community reporting, and mobile data collection can provide channels for communities to input and validate data.

## Recommendations for Donors

**For bilateral and multilateral institutions:** Fund ocean accounting pilots in countries where (1) marine resources are critical to poverty reduction; (2) development pressures threaten coastal ecosystems; and (3) government demonstrates commitment to institutional integration. Prioritize countries developing national poverty reduction and climate adaptation plans that could be informed by ocean accounts.

**For conservation organizations:** Reframe marine conservation not as separate from poverty reduction but as foundational to it. Ocean accounts provide evidence that healthy ecosystems are economically rational investments for sustainable development, attracting broader political support beyond conservation constituencies.

**For capacity building programs:** Train national statisticians and planners in ocean accounting frameworks aligned with UN System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) standards, ensuring comparability across countries and compatibility with national economic accounting systems.

**For policy dialogue facilitators:** Support evidence-based negotiations over competing resource uses by positioning ocean accounts as neutral information infrastructure. Cases from Mozambique and the Philippines demonstrate that when objective data replace assumption-driven debates, poor stakeholders' interests gain policy traction.

## Conclusion

Sustainable poverty reduction in coastal regions requires integrating ocean health into development policy in ways current frameworks do not. Ocean accounts offer a practical, internationally standardized approach to overcome institutional inertia and enable evidence-based decision-making that protects both natural capital and human wellbeing. By making visible the dependencies of poor communities on ocean ecosystems, accounts translate scientific understanding into actionable evidence for policymakers—transforming how development is planned and how conservation investments are justified. Donors investing in this infrastructure now can catalyze a fundamental shift toward development approaches that deliver on both poverty reduction and environmental sustainability goals.
