# Making the invisible visible: accounting for the linkages between ocean health and poverty

## Summary

Nature and the environment are often overlooked in poverty reduction strategies, creating fundamental gaps in our understanding of who experiences poverty, how and why. This oversight is particularly problematic for coastal communities who depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods–as their reality continues to be inadequately integrated into development and environmental policies and measures of poverty and wellbeing (Schleicher et al., 2025). The consequence of development policies, strategies and initiatives ignoring environmental links and dependencies is that they frequently undermine the very ecosystems that communities rely on for their livelihoods, inadvertently deepening poverty rather than alleviating it (UNEP-WCMC, 2020). 

Ocean accounts provide a systematic framework to address these gaps by integrating environmental, social, and economic data. Through comprehensive measurement of ecosystem service flows and social characteristics of resource users, ocean accounts illuminate the invisible dependencies of communities on natural capital and translate these relationships into actionable evidence for policymakers. The framework enables identification of vulnerable coastal communities through multiple dimensions, including natural resource reliance, geographic vulnerability, ecosystem service benefits, adaptive capacity, and social inequities. Global case studies from terrestrial and ocean environments demonstrate both the consequences of uninformed decision-making and the transformative potential of integrated ocean accounting approaches.

Achieving sustainable poverty reduction requires integrating ecosystem service flows into policy frameworks. Delivering a sustainable blue economy is driven by our ability to close knowledge gaps on the drivers and outcomes of resource use and management to identify equitable pathways for transformation. Better integrated information is essential for unlocking natural resource routes out of poverty, closing poverty traps and avoiding adverse side effects from conservation policies (Bass and Steele 2015). Without this integrated approach, there is no hope of effectively tackling multidimensional poverty. However, institutional frameworks often lack alignment with scientific discourse, creating barriers to policy reform. The ocean accounts process addresses this challenge through systematic information provision, capacity building, and institutional awareness-raising to overcome inertia and enable evidence-based decision-making that protects both ocean health and human wellbeing.

1. ## Introduction

Over 3 billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods in some way and in developing countries natural capital makes up 36 percent of their total wealth (World Bank, 2023; Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2021; Bass and Steele, 2015). For coastal communities, natural assets such as mangroves and coral reefs, often represent the most accessible resources to support income and food security (Lok et al., 2019). In times of difficulty, such as during the pandemic, natural assets provide a form of social safety net to coastal communities. For example, Lauer et al (2024) documents significant increases in fishing by boat in coastal communities for food security and income purposes in French Polynesia during the pandemic. In addition to food, income and social security, coastal ecosystems also serve as buffers from extreme weather events offering physical as well as economic protection in terms of crisis. 

Despite the well documented importance of coastal assets and natural capital for the well-being of coastal communities, both communities, and the natural assets upon which they depend, often face limited policy appreciation and informal governance systems. This limits their ability to safeguard their asset base and the flow of ecosystems services provided by it (Evans et al., 2023; Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2021). Likewise, our measures of economic performance, GDP and others, and policy design approaches ignore natural capital and perpetuate a poverty trap (Bass and Steele, 2015).

Cisneros-Montemayor (2021) find that achieving a sustainable blue economy is less related to the availability of natural resources and instead success is driven by closing knowledge gaps on the drivers and outcomes of resource use and management to identify equitable pathways for transformation. Many countries lack the standardised tools and policy approaches to close these knowledge gaps and therefore natural capital is too often used in ways that do not benefit the poor. Incorporating environmental considerations, ecosystem services and people into policy design thus continues to be a priority for devising more adequate, effective and impactful development policy approaches (Alkire and Jahan, 2018; Mohammed et al., 2016). 

2. ## Environment, well-being and poverty measurement and policy

The World Bank estimated that climate change will increase the number of people in poverty by up to 132 million by 2030 compared to 2020 (World Bank, 2020)[^1], with the livelihoods of rural low-elevation coastal zone populations most at risk (Barbier, 2015). Despite the clear positive correlation between poverty, climate and environmental vulnerability (Rana et al, 2023), environmental deprivation external to the household is rarely considered in poverty assessment, well-being analysis or development planning creating a significant gap in policy making and decision processes (Lange et al., 2018). For example, only six of the 42 countries with official national multidimensional poverty indices include environment as a factor (Ocheng, 2024). 

Historically, economic indicators alone have guided economic expansion, investment, and strategic planning. As a result, the distribution of costs and benefits, indirect flow-on impacts and interconnections and dependencies of the poor on the environment are neither “transparent nor included in decisions – to the detriment of natural resource management and poverty reduction policies” (Bass and Steele 2015). 

More integrated information on the use of the ocean system is a first step to opening up natural resource routes out of poverty and to closing poverty traps as well as avoiding harm or adverse effects from conservation policies (Bass and Steele 2015). As Evans et al (2023) describes “New approaches to ocean governance for coastal communities are needed. With few exceptions, the status quo does not meet the diverse development aspirations of coastal communities or ensure healthy oceans for current and future generations”.

Incorporating environmental considerations and ecosystem service thinking into multidimensional poverty assessments, developmental and ocean policy design thus should be a priority for devising more adequate policy approaches, informing the policy and management design process and enhancing the effectiveness of policy impacts (Alkire and Jahan, 2018). However, to support inclusion, tools and institutional reform is needed; institutional workings are out of date and preclude the development of new ideas and innovation as they are not well aligned with scientific discourse or designed for its systematic inclusion in processes (Ferraro, 2022). 

Schleicher et al. (2025) found that the integration of environmental dimensions into planning scenarios, identifying new target areas for poverty reduction strategies. Mohammed et al. (2016) highlights how an improved understanding of natural and coastal values and functions can help in assessing the feasibility of development projects, increasing the effectiveness of such projects. Thus, “integrating environmental indicators…is not just a technical exercise but a powerful tool for policymakers, helping them to make informed decisions and take necessary action to accelerate progress toward eradicating poverty in all its forms” Ocheng (2024). 

3. ## Ocean Accounts

 “For environmental indicators to provide a common language for policymakers to monitor progress and guide policy interventions, environmental deprivations must be measurable, relevant, and actionable” (Ocheng, 2024). Accordingly, tools and processes are needed to ensure the inclusion of ocean and coastal assets and the services which they provide in business-as-usual policy making processes. Accounting systems that go beyond economic metrics and integrate societal, economic and environmental information to measure and manage progress towards ocean sustainable development are essential (Loureiro et al., 2023). Through integrated data compilation, advanced ocean accounts bring together environment, economic and social indicators to provide a tool for policy makers to design more holistic policy. Ocean accounts provides a systematic information system describing the assets that poor people and low-income countries depend on for income, livelihoods, health, security and resilience (Mohammed et al., 2016). However, even an account based on one of these domains will provide valuable information to improve the inclusion of environmental indicators and use of these data within decision processes.

The ocean accounting framework – specifically via the ecosystem services flows and social accounting domain – provides a mechanism where the environmental assets are the foundation for reporting and accounting for social and economic wellbeing (Eigenraam & Choi, 2017). This is not just in principle but applied in practice. For example, China’s eco-compensation programs, Brazil’s Bolsa Floresta scheme, or India’s national rural employment guarantee act, all tie resource conservation or restoration to job creation and income support for low-income households. The UK Darwin Initiative project in Uganda “Integrating Natural Capital into Sustainable Development Decision Making in Uganda”, worked with Ugandan agencies to also incorporate biodiversity and ecosystem values into national poverty reduction and planning processes. The policy challenge is understanding where to target investments to achieve the greatest social, economic and environmental outcomes and determine the level of investment required both now and in the future (Eigenraam & Choi, 2017). 

Ocean accounts provide a framework to meet this challenge. They enable the identification and understanding of vulnerable coastal communities through multiple dimensions, thereby supporting approaches to reducing poverty while protecting ocean health. Through environmental, social, and economic data, ocean accounts reveal:

* **Natural resource reliance**: Communities most dependent on healthy marine environments can be identified, highlighting those with limited alternative economic opportunities (Béné et al., 2016\)

* **Geographic vulnerability**: Spatial analysis pinpoints communities facing the greatest exposure to environmental degradation, pollution, and climate impacts, especially those lacking protective infrastructure (Neumann et al., 2015\)

* **Ecosystem service benefits**: Ocean accounts identify who benefits from the ecosystem services from ocean natural capital and who suffers from environmental degradation (Kumar n.d.)  

* **Adaptive capacity**: Socioeconomic indicators highlight communities with least access to the supportive natural and hard infrastructure needed for adaptation (Islam and Winkel, 2017\) 

* **Social inequities**: Social data reveals how women, and other groups, in coastal communities face additional barriers through limited resource rights and constrained mobility options (Harper et al., 2013\)

* **Generational impacts**: Long-term monitoring shows how environmental degradation perpetuates poverty cycles through reduced natural capital (Barbier, 2015\)

Ocean accounts therefore extend beyond simple income-based poverty measurement to encompass the multidimensional ways oceans contribute to wellbeing, especially for poor and vulnerable coastal communities. Advanced ocean accounting applications can highlight the challenges faced by minority groups (e.g. women, youth, and ethnic minorities) who are poorly represented in decision-making frameworks and policy design.

As noted by Ferraro (2022), institutions are not well aligned with scientific discourse. Policy change and institutionalisation is a long term process requiring trust and timely engagement; efforts thus far have focused on short-term, values-based, projects which do not have traction in institutions and fail to make change (Bass and Steele 2015). The ocean accounting framework and the approach of GOAP aims to tackle this in a systematic manner though information provision, close cooperation and decision maker awareness raising and capacity support to overcome institutional inertia and support officials to enable them to integrate these considerations into business-as-usual policy development in an easily understandable and effective manner. The GOAP document “GOAP Pathways to Systems Change: A Transformative Framework” describes the process by which this institutional inertia can be overcome, and policy reform occur.

4. ## Avoiding Harmful Decisions

Decision-makers who fail to understand the ecosystem services upon which people depend risk implementing poorly designed policy that actively harms the people and environments they are trying to protect. In instances where uninformed decision-making occurs, well-meaning environmental protection policies may inadvertently ignore distributional impacts on poor communities, or poverty reduction programs may incentivise unsustainable resource use. Yet, the evidence and policy narratives and actions remain largely disconnected (Béné et al., 2016). There are significant hidden costs that market-driven ocean development can impose on coastal communities (Evans, 2023).

Understanding the different dimensions and distribution of ecosystem services is crucial for designing equitable policies that protect both ocean health and human wellbeing. In this section four case studies are discussed which demonstrate the impact of market-driven well meaningwell-meaning policies can have on local populations. Botswana’s water accounts demonstrate the potential impact of taking a decision that did not take account of societal wellbeing.  

| Botswana Water Accounts Botswana water accounts revealed a dilemma: the agriculture sector was the highest water user in the country. 43 per cent of the water in the country was used for agricultural purposes. However, the sector contributes relatively low amounts to GDP and formal employment. In contrast, the service sector, notably tourism, produces significant added value from each m3 of water consumed. An economic view point would recommend reallocation of water to the service sector away from the agricultural sector. However, the informal and small-scale agricultural enterprises, hidden in official statistics, support significant numbers of people providing income and food security opportunities. It also provides people in rural areas with a critical social safety net. The consequence of not taking a full assessment of the water sector could have been severe for those whose livelihoods depend on the ecosystem services provided by water supply.

The second case study is of the Nippon Causeway, which was constructed in 1985, in South Tarawa Kiribati, a key development project designed to enhance the connectivity of the islands but resulted in significant wider impacts on the population of South Tarawa. 

| The Nippon Causeway, South Tarawa, Kiribati The Nippon Causeway, constructed in 1985, stands as a testament to the complex and often unforeseen consequences of infrastructure development in vulnerable environments. This near-solid causeway, stretching over 3.4 kilometres, was built to enhance connectivity between the two islands of South Tarawa, Kiribati, and it succeeded in significantly improving transportation links. However, the project's design overlooked critical environmental considerations, resulting in a range of detrimental ecological, health, and livelihood impacts. The causeway's construction altered the lagoon's natural water cycling patterns. The restricted flow led to a significant accumulation of waste within the lagoon, creating unsanitary conditions that negatively impacted public health. Studies have shown that faecal contamination of lagoon water and shellfish flesh in South Tarawa often exceeds safe levels, posing health risks to the local population.  The algal bloom that occurred in December 2009/January 2010 indicated that nutrient loads entering the lagoon exceeded what could be effectively dispersed by lagoon flushing or taken up by the marine benthic biota, leading to significant ecological damage. The build-up of pollutants contributed to ecosystem decline, leading to a decline in fish populations, a crucial food source for the local population.  The causeway also had a profound effect on local fishing practices. Fishers who traditionally kept their boats on the lagoon side of the atoll now faced significantly longer journeys to reach productive fishing grounds in the open ocean. This increased travel time translated directly into higher operating costs, reducing profitability and threatening the livelihoods of fishing communities.    While the Nippon Causeway undeniably improved connectivity, its negative impacts highlight the critical importance of system understanding and community ecosystem use data in economic development projects. The case of the Nippon Causeway serves as a cautionary tale, emphasising the need for sustainable development approaches that prioritize ecological understanding and the long-term well-being of local communities.

The power of ocean accounts is not just in the development of the accounts but the conversations that the process opens with ministries and planning authorities as demonstrated by the case study of Mozambique.

| Inhambane Bay, Mozambique Across Inhambane Bay ocean accounts were used to quantify the ecosystem services provided by over 400,000 hectares of coastal ecosystems. Through systematic measurement of ecosystem extent and community dependencies, the results provided evidence for more equitable coastal management decisions. The accounts captured diverse ecosystem benefits ranging from direct use provisioning ecosystem services (fishing, shellfish collection), indirect provisioning services (nursery habitats) and regulating services (coastal protection). This assessment revealed how ecosystem services support both immediate economic needs and long-term community resilience as well as identifying groups who were not included in national statistics.  The ocean accounts approach highlighted limitations within the national data systems and statistics. It enabled a conversation about improving inclusivity of statistics and the Mozambican government is now considering integrating ocean dependence metrics into the national census.

Demonstrating the power of ecosystem accounts, such as in the Philippines case study below, can lead to the long-term integration of the accounting approach in decision making across other sectors.

| Philippines: Ecosystem accounts to resolve competing uses The Philippines piloted ecosystem accounts in two regions where poor communities and commercial interests competed over natural resources. In Palawan, a biodiverse province with significant poverty, the accounts captured the value of intact ecosystems for eco-tourism and sustainable fisheries versus the short-term profits of mining newly discovered mineral deposits. This accounting fed into a policy dialogue: should certain areas be protected for tourism and subsistence use by local communities or opened to mining which might bring revenue but also environmental damage?  The accounts provided objective estimates of the long-run benefits of forests for water regulation, non-timber products, and tourism jobs – giving weight to arguments for conservation that benefits local livelihoods. In the Laguna Lake area, the accounts highlighted how large-scale commercial fishing and upstream pollution were affecting the lake’s health, to the detriment of small-scale fishers who rely on the lake for income. By quantifying losses in fish catch and water quality in monetary terms, the ecosystem accounts elevated the voices of these poorer stakeholders in policy discussions about lake management.  In both cases, the ecosystem accounts served as a neutral information base to negotiate resource use conflicts, ensuring that the interests of poorer resource users were considered alongside economic development goals. These early examples have influenced the Philippines’ continued work on ecosystem accounting for coastal fisheries and watersheds as tools in its poverty reduction and rural development strategies.

5. ## Conclusion

The inextricable link between ocean health and human wellbeing in coastal communities is widely recognised, yet too often this critical relationship is overlooked or undervalued in decision-making because of a lack of available and policy relevant quantitative and qualitative data. Conventional policy approaches that separate environmental, economic and social considerations fail to capture the complex interdependencies that shape the lives of the over 3 billion people who rely on the ocean. For poor and vulnerable coastal populations who depend directly on marine and coastal resources, environmental action is integral to poverty action and livelihood resilience.

Ocean accounts offer a powerful tool for overcoming this disconnect by integrating diverse data into a comprehensive framework. Through understanding of the ecosystem service flows and social characteristics of resource users, ocean accounting illuminates the invisible dependencies of communities on natural capital. Ocean accounts not only make these relationships visible but also translate them into actionable evidence for policy makers. Armed with a clear understanding of the use of ecosystems, distributional impacts of environmental change and the true value of environmental services, decision-makers can design interventions that protect both natural capital and human wellbeing. Conversely, without such integrated frameworks, policies risk perpetuating the cycle of environmental degradation and poverty by undermining the very resource base that supports coastal populations. Cisneros-Montemayor (2021) suggests that policymakers must engage researchers and stakeholders to promote evidence-based, collaborative planning that ensures that the blue economy delivers on its social, environmental and economic goals. 

The uptake of ecosystem service thinking within policy processes is however “advancing slowly” (Ferraro, 2022). For enduring impact, institutional frameworks governing decision-making must adapt to new realities, but all suffer from institutional inertia. Overcoming that inertia is a cogitative, organisational and political challenge. Through the process of account development, capacity support and awareness raising the Global Ocean Accounts Partnership moves this process from a scientific debate to being embedded in national practices.

## Technical Framework

The Ocean Accounts Framework comprises the following specific account types:

| Ocean assets accounts (natural capital accounts):  | Environmental asset accounts (extent and condition of biotic and abiotic components)  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Flows to environment accounts (residuals):   | Flows from the economy (pollutants, residuals) to the ocean environment  Physical flow accounts for emissions, effluents, and solid waste  |
| Social Accounts: | Social assets and conditions flowing from environmental assets  |
| Governance accounts:  | Features of ocean governance that shape impacts on the ocean environment and economy  |
| Flows to economy accounts (supply and use accounts): | Flows of goods and services from the ocean to the economy  Physical flow accounts  Monetary flow accounts  |
| National ocean wealth accounts:  | Comprised of social, environmental and economic assets  |
| Ocean economy satellite accounts:  | Economic contributions of ocean-related industry sectors  |

These account types form the core structure of the Ocean Accounts Framework, integrating physical, monetary, and qualitative data to provide a comprehensive picture of ocean-related stocks, flows, and governance. 

The below tables provide examples of linkages between various ocean account types and coastal poverty mechanisms as a means of demonstrating the utility of accounts in understanding the importance of ocean ecosystems to coastal peoples.

## Ocean Asset Accounts (Natural Capital)

Natural capital accounts form the foundation for understanding how marine resource availability and condition directly affect poverty outcomes. These accounts track both the extent and health of marine ecosystems, as well as their spatial relationship to poor communities, providing crucial insights into the resource base available for poverty reduction.

| Component | Key elements | Example poverty and livelihood linkages  |

## Policy Applications

# **Integrated Ocean-Poverty Account Framework **

Note: This framework enables integrated analysis of poverty-environment relationships in marine contexts. For example, the spatial relationship between poor fishing communities and productive fishing grounds can be analyzed alongside resource condition to understand both access to and sustainability of marine resources. These relationships can inform targeted interventions that support both poverty reduction and resource sustainability.
